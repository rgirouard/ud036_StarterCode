# Entertainment Center

First, thank you for downloading this application.  We hope you enjoy it.  If you have not downloaded, please see instructions to dowload the application.  Entertainment Center is an application that displays a list of favorite movies and shows the movie trailer once a movie icon has been selected

  - Displays a Teaser Poster of the movie in a quality image format.
  - Watch the Trailer with the click of a mouse
  - Add to the list of movies

# Download Entertainment Center Application

  - If you do not have Python 3.6 installed then please go here to [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install.
Once finished you are now ready to see how it works.

# How the application works!

  - Open entertainment_center.py from Python IDLE.  If you do not have your favorite movies listed, please use the following steps to populate your list:
  - Simply Edit the names of the current movies list. Change "wonderful_life = media.Movie...to {your favorite movie}.media.Movie.  It is easier to keep the movie name to two words when possible.
  - Next edit the contents of media.Movie inside the parenthesis.  Movie Title, Story Line, Teaser Poster Image, and Youtube Trailer.  I used IMDB for the story line, Wikipedia for the teaser poster and a search of {your movie title} "youtube movie trailer" will get you what you need.
  - Make copies of each media.Movie code to add more movies.
  - Finally, edit/add the movie list in the movie [] array and save the program.

### Run the Program
Select Run - Run Module from the IDLE menu and your list website will be displayed.
